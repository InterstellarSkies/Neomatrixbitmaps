The purpose of this code is to read a bitmap file on an SD card inside an Arduino Yun convert into an array which is read by a 
simple draw program.


This code is made specifically for Arduino Yun and the Adafruit 8x8 Neopixel matrix, if desired you can tweak the code to use the SDcard library
rather than the Bridge Library. 

Hope you enjoyit!
